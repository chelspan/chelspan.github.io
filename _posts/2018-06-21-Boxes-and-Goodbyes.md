(Originally written **June 13th**, but I messed up the formatting and it didn't post. Whoop.)

  I find myself really oscillating lately. I'm in the process of packing up my room right now - it's really just an extended period of starting and stopping, tossing and retrieving. How do I know what to take? What to let go of? It feels almost impossible. Everything feels merely half done.
  
  I've been saying a lot of goodbyes lately. I've had my last appointments for two separate physical therapy treatments that I've been seeing for the better part of a year. I had a final lunch with a grad student I'd been working with since my Freshman year. This morning I had my last appointment with my psychiatrist - I've been seeing her for three and a half years. There's no eloquent way to say goodbye to someone that knows that much about you. She gave me a card. I thought it was really sweet. There are more words to say, but I don't quite have them yet. 
  
  By packing up, am I saying goodbye to my room? Am I saying goodbye to the college version of me who has college-appropriate things? Am I saying goodbye to my role as Resident Assistant in this strange, complicated queer co-op? Am I saying goodbye to a life of built-in structure? 
  
  Most of it, in truth, hasn't really hit me yet. I can't seem to wrap my mind around the fact that when I open my drawers, they'll be empty. I don't have therapy appointments lined up for next week. I will not be a Stanford student again.
  
  I can't ever seem to think about what it means for something to be over until it's over. I don't know how to miss people. 
  
  This post, like most other things right now, seems incomplete. I'm having trouble with endings lately.
  
  I must remember to send my psychiatrist yearly holiday cards.
