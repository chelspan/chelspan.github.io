It's hard to fully grasp what it means to be "done." I've been a student my entire conscious life. The next step was always certain - go to 10th grade, then 11th. Finish high school, go to college. But now, I could do anything. I have things to decide on.

Somehow I thought the end would come with the promise of long-withheld triumph. It doesn't matter that this was one of the hardest years of my life, it doesn't matter that I'd failed time and time again. By school year's close, everything would have clicked into place. I search for meaning in the water stains on my carpet, even when I'm the one that put them there. Everything had to fall apart so that I could be remade. Build back stronger, become more wholly myself. I can still hear the ringing from the night I burst my eardrum. There's purpose in that too.

I finished my last final this morning. The final presentation for my honor's thesis - a project I'd toiled away at consistently over the past year and change - was this past Thursday. As with most things I've done in the past few weeks (months?), the end result just barely stumbled over the finish line, half confused and entirely disheveled. It seems like all my sentences lately have been half written. Over-practiced, under prepared. During my Chinese final, I'd forgotten how to write the word "start." One could also translate it as "to begin."  

I'm still unemployed. I graduate in eight days.

I thought I would be in New York City. I felt the bristling cold creeping through the folds of my sweater. I heard myself pushing through clicking turnstiles, imagined paying exhorbitant ticket prices because even now I'm a sucker for theater. I saw meaning in the flash of white highbeams growing larger and larger, spilling out of the corner of my eye and into every darkened road. Back to where it came from. I thought the circumstances of my life were puzzle pieces. This one must go here so that you can connect these disparate parts. It'll all make sense. There are no superfluous components. There are no accidents.

I think I'm afraid of uncertainty. It's easier to look for the hidden meanings than it is to accept that I've made a mistake. It'll all be worth it as long as it mattered. Crushed metal means nothing against the promise of a better tomorrow. I need the pain to be *necessary*.

But sometimes bad things just happen. I'm learning to be okay with that.
