I'm back in my hometown right now for jury duty. In total, I'll be here about a week. It's quite strange being out here, in no small part because my family is away or out of town. So I'm alone. Sleeping in my teenaged bedroom, on top of Christmas themed bedsheets. It's all weird.

I'm reminded of being 17 again. Not just the vibe of living in a certain city and in a certain house, but rather in the ways that one's external environment quietly colors your perspective. I feel like I'm slipping back into old thoughts, old patterns. Did I eat a full meal today? When's the last time my palms stopped burning? That last phone call was the most caustic I have been in months. I'm having trouble processing pain.

I think the problem is that I'm not really alone. I'm sitting with the ghosts of past selves, walking through clouds of old worries. The mirror in my room shows a distorted image. It's long and narrow, angled in such a way as to make anything reflected in it seem longer and narrower too. I was obsessed with that mirror, even though I didn't understand its particular distortions. The problem is that I never could recognize myself, no matter how long I stared or through what medium, and as such I could never recognize when it <i>wasn't</i> myself. 

Coming back to Worcester reminds me of what once wallpapered the interiors of my mind. I'm genuinely impressed with my ability to remember how to get to various places - no small feat given that I'm ridiculously shitty at directions. But Main South Worcester is small. And remarkably consistent. Maybe understanding who you currently are requires reckoning with who you once were. 

I want to forget.
